I was thinking about playing a bit of Go online again but the popular Korean 
Tygem Go server only has software support for Windows OS. I could have run it in Windows 
Parallells for Mac in a virtual computer but I found this link describing how 
to run it directly in Mac OS via Wineskin.

[Tygem guide for Mac](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s287/sh/00099ac5-5169-4ed9-865c-3b2a744e78b9/d5a37226328312b4)

It works well for me, I'm currently running Mac OS Sierra v. 10.12.5. 
Wineskin is a utility to manage Wine engine versions and create wrappers so 
it appears like a normal Mac application.
